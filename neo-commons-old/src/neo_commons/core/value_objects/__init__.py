"""
Core value objects for the NeoMultiTenant platform.

Value objects are immutable types that represent conceptual values in the
domain. They provide type safety, validation, and semantic meaning to
primitive types like strings and UUIDs.

Features:
- Type-safe wrappers around primitive types
- Automatic validation on creation
- UUIDv7 generation for time-ordered identifiers
- Rich comparison and hashing behavior
