## Project-Wide Patterns Discovered

- Python packages use conditional imports with setuptools detection for installation compatibility
- __all__ lists are explicitly maintained for public API control across modules
- Module docstrings consistently explain purpose and functionality at package level
- Version information imported from single source of truth (__version__.py pattern)
- Environment-aware configuration using factory pattern for dev/prod/test environments
- Middleware configuration uses dataclass with field defaults from environment variables
- Security middleware implements comprehensive header coverage with environment-aware defaults for dev/prod
