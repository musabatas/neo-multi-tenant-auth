    <issue category="security" severity="HIGH">
      <title>ReDoS Vulnerability in Dynamic Regex Compilation</title>
      <location>Lines 174, 72</location>
      <description>User-provided regex patterns are compiled and executed without validation, creating potential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities. Malicious patterns like (a+)+b can cause exponential backtracking.</description>
      <recommendation>Add regex complexity validation, timeout for regex execution, and pattern whitelisting. Consider using re2 library for safer regex processing.</recommendation>
    </issue>

    <issue category="security" severity="HIGH">
      <title>Uncontrolled Pattern Processing</title>
      <location>Lines 63-74</location>
      <description>Automatic pattern anchoring and compilation of arbitrary regex patterns without size limits or complexity checks. No protection against catastrophic backtracking or memory exhaustion.</description>
      <recommendation>Implement pattern validation, size limits, complexity scoring, and execution timeouts. Add pattern sanitization before compilation.</recommendation>
    </issue>

    <issue category="performance" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Unbounded Pattern Cache Growth</title>
      <location>Line 46</location>
      <description>The _compiled_patterns cache grows indefinitely without size limits or eviction policy, potentially causing memory exhaustion over time in long-running processes.</description>
      <recommendation>Implement LRU cache with size limit (e.g., using functools.lru_cache or custom implementation) and add cache metrics monitoring.</recommendation>
    </issue>

    <issue category="performance" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Inefficient Nested Dictionary Traversal</title>
      <location>Lines 181-192</location>
      <description>The _get_nested_value method uses recursive dictionary lookups with string splitting for each field access, creating O(n) complexity for deep nesting.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider caching parsed field paths or using more efficient nested access patterns. Add depth limits to prevent excessive nesting.</recommendation>
    </issue>

    <issue category="consistency" severity="HIGH">
      <title>Inconsistent Protocol Usage</title>
      <location>Line 9</location>
      <description>Uses ABC instead of @runtime_checkable Protocol pattern that is standard across the neo-commons platform for dependency injection.</description>
      <recommendation>Replace ABC with @runtime_checkable Protocol to maintain consistency with platform patterns: from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable.</recommendation>
    </issue>

    <issue category="consistency" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Missing Neo-Commons Import Patterns</title>
      <location>Lines 3-6</location>
      <description>Imports don't follow neo-commons convention of relative imports within features (from .domain import, from .application import).</description>
      <recommendation>Refactor imports to use relative imports within the feature module following neo-commons patterns.</recommendation>
    </issue>

    <issue category="best_practices" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Broad Exception Handling</title>
      <location>Lines 38, 60, 94</location>
      <description>Generic 'except Exception' blocks suppress all errors without logging, making debugging difficult and potentially hiding important failures.</description>
      <recommendation>Use specific exception handling with proper logging. Create custom exceptions for pattern-specific failures and log errors for observability.</recommendation>
    </issue>

    <issue category="best_practices" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Missing Type Specificity</title>
      <location>Lines 207-208</location>
      <description>Function parameters use generic List type instead of specific entity types, reducing type safety and IDE support.</description>
      <recommendation>Use specific types like List[EventActionSubscription], List[Action] instead of generic List to improve type safety and documentation.</recommendation>
    </issue>

    <issue category="best_practices" severity="LOW">
      <title>Missing Structured Logging Context</title>
      <location>Throughout</location>
      <description>No structured logging with context (tenant_id, user_id, request_id) as expected in neo-commons platform standards.</description>
      <recommendation>Add structured logging with context information for better observability and debugging capabilities.</recommendation>
    </issue>

    <issue category="maintainability" severity="LOW">
      <title>Magic Numbers in Pattern Detection</title>
      <location>Lines 269-281</location>
      <description>Hard-coded heuristics for regex detection without documentation or configurability. Pattern detection logic is brittle and hard to maintain.</description>
      <recommendation>Extract regex indicators to constants with documentation. Consider making pattern detection configurable or using more robust pattern type detection.</recommendation>
    </issue>

    <issue category="code_smell" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Large Class with Multiple Responsibilities</title>
      <location>Lines 195-281</location>
      <description>EventActionMatcher class handles both pattern matching logic and action filtering/sorting, violating single responsibility principle.</description>
      <recommendation>Split into separate classes: PatternMatchingService and ActionFilterService following neo-commons maximum separation principle.</recommendation>
    </issue>
  </issues>

  <summary>Event pattern matching engine with good separation of pattern types but suffers from security vulnerabilities around regex processing and consistency issues with neo-commons platform patterns. The architecture provides good abstraction but needs security hardening and protocol consistency fixes.</summary>

  <positive_observations>
    <observation>Good separation of pattern types with dedicated classes for glob, regex, and condition matching</observation>
    <observation>Comprehensive condition matching with support for logical operators ($and, $or, $not) and comparison operators</observation>
    <observation>Proper async/await patterns throughout the codebase</observation>
    <observation>Good documentation with examples for each pattern type</observation>
    <observation>Effective caching strategy for compiled regex patterns (though needs bounds)</observation>
    <observation>Support for nested field access with dot notation in condition matching</observation>
  </positive_observations>

  <context>
    <tests>No test files found in the immediate vicinity - would benefit from comprehensive unit tests for pattern matching logic</tests>
    <documentation>Good inline documentation with examples, though missing overall architecture documentation</documentation>
    <configuration>No configuration files found - pattern matching behavior appears to be hardcoded</configuration>
