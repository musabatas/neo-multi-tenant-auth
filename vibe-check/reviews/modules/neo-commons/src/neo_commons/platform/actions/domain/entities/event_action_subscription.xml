      <title>Regex injection vulnerability in matches_conditions</title>
      <location>Line 172-174</location>
      <description>The $regex condition operator uses user-provided regex patterns without validation, potentially allowing ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks through malicious regex patterns</description>
      <recommendation>Add regex validation, timeout controls, and pattern complexity limits. Consider using a safe regex library or implementing a whitelist of allowed patterns</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="performance" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Inefficient rate limiting algorithm</title>
      <location>Line 202-234</location>
      <description>Rate limiting uses simple in-memory counters with potentially inefficient window management. The logic recalculates time windows on every check and doesn't properly handle edge cases across window boundaries</description>
      <recommendation>Implement sliding window rate limiting or use token bucket algorithm. Consider external rate limiting service (Redis) for distributed scenarios</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="performance" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>O(n) tenant filter lookup</title>
      <location>Line 115-119</location>
      <description>Tenant, organization, and source service filter matching uses linear search through lists, which becomes inefficient with large filter sets</description>
      <recommendation>Convert filter lists to sets for O(1) lookup performance, especially important for high-volume event processing</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Mutable entity state modification without proper state management</title>
      <location>Line 207-209, 217-219, 227-229</location>
      <description>The is_rate_limited method directly modifies entity state (rate_limit_window_start, current_rate_count) which violates proper state management principles and could cause race conditions</description>
      <recommendation>Separate rate limiting state management into a dedicated component or use immutable state transitions with proper event sourcing</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="code_smell" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Long complex method with multiple responsibilities</title>
      <location>Line 133-180</location>
      <description>The matches_conditions method handles multiple condition types ($eq, $ne, $in, $gt, etc.) in a single 47-line method with deep nesting and multiple concerns</description>
      <recommendation>Extract condition matching logic into separate strategy classes or methods per condition type for better maintainability and testability</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="code_smell" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Import inside method reduces performance</title>
      <location>Line 172</location>
      <description>The re module is imported inside the matches_conditions method, which creates unnecessary overhead when called frequently</description>
      <recommendation>Move the regex import to the top of the file with other imports</recommendation>

  <summary>EventActionSubscription is a well-structured domain entity that handles event-to-action mapping with filtering, rate limiting, and condition matching. The implementation follows neo-commons patterns with proper validation and state management, though there are some security and performance concerns that should be addressed for production use.</summary>

  <positive_observations>
    <observation>Excellent use of dataclass with comprehensive __post_init__ validation following neo-commons patterns</observation>
    <observation>Well-organized method grouping with clear separation of concerns (matching, rate limiting, state management)</observation>
    <observation>Comprehensive factory method with proper parameter validation and defensive copying</observation>
    <observation>Good audit trail implementation with automatic timestamp updates</observation>
    <observation>Proper soft delete pattern implementation following database conventions</observation>
    <observation>Consistent type hints throughout the class with proper Optional usage</observation>
    <observation>Clear documentation with detailed docstrings explaining functionality</observation>
    <observation>Flexible condition matching system supporting multiple operators</observation>
  </positive_observations>

  <context>
    <tests>No test files found for this entity. Unit tests should cover edge cases in condition matching, rate limiting window boundaries, and validation logic.</tests>
    <documentation>Well-documented with comprehensive docstrings. Class and method documentation follows Google style conventions.</documentation>
    <configuration>Entity designed to work with both admin.event_subscriptions and tenant_template.event_subscriptions database tables as noted in class docstring.</configuration>
