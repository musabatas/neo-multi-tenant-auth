      <title>UUID Generation Without UUIDv7</title>
      <location>Line 123</location>
      <description>Using uuid.uuid4() for request ID generation instead of UUIDv7 as specified in project standards. UUIDv7 provides time-ordering which improves index performance.</description>
      <recommendation>Use a centralized UUIDv7 generation utility instead of uuid.uuid4() to maintain consistency with project standards.</recommendation>

      <title>Production Environment Detection</title>
      <location>Lines 88-90, 172-173, 258-260</location>
      <description>API documentation endpoints are conditionally exposed based on is_production flag. Ensure this flag is properly set in production to avoid exposing internal API structure.</description>
      <recommendation>Add validation that is_production is correctly configured and consider using a more robust environment detection mechanism.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="security" severity="LOW">
      <title>Error Information Disclosure</title>
      <location>Lines 156-159</location>
      <description>While the code properly limits error details in production, the development mode exposes full exception messages which could leak sensitive information if misconfigured.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider implementing a whitelist of safe error messages even in development mode.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="performance" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Synchronous Permission Sync on Startup</title>
      <location>Lines 43-48</location>
      <description>Permission synchronization runs synchronously during startup, potentially delaying application readiness. This could impact deployment times and health checks.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider running permission sync in the background after startup or implementing a lazy initialization pattern.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="performance" severity="LOW">
      <title>Redundant Time Calculations</title>
      <location>Lines 194-197, 218-221</location>
      <description>Multiple time.time() calls for latency calculation could be simplified using a context manager or utility function.</description>
      <recommendation>Create a timing utility to reduce code duplication and improve consistency.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="maintainability" severity="LOW">
      <title>Inline Import in Middleware</title>
      <location>Line 122</location>
      <description>The uuid module is imported inside the middleware function rather than at module level, which could impact readability.</description>
      <recommendation>Move the import to the top of the file with other imports.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="consistency" severity="LOW">
      <title>Mixed Import Patterns</title>
      <location>Lines 185-187</location>
      <description>Local imports inside the health_check function differ from the module-level import pattern used elsewhere.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider using consistent import patterns throughout the file.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Hardcoded API Prefix Logic</title>
      <location>Lines 305-330</location>
      <description>The dual registration pattern with and without API prefix creates complexity and potential for routing conflicts.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider using a single registration pattern with middleware-based prefix handling or a more elegant routing solution.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="LOW">
      <title>Commented Future Code</title>
      <location>Lines 277-279, 333-335</location>
      <description>Commented-out router imports and registrations should be tracked in a TODO system rather than left in code.</description>
      <recommendation>Remove commented code and track future implementations in project management tools.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="code_smell" severity="LOW">
      <title>Long Function</title>
      <location>Lines 80-263</location>
      <description>The create_app function is 183 lines long, exceeding the 50-line limit specified in project standards. It handles multiple responsibilities including middleware setup, exception handlers, and route registration.</description>
      <recommendation>Refactor into smaller functions: setup_middleware(), setup_exception_handlers(), setup_documentation(), and setup_health_endpoints().</recommendation>
    </issue>

  <summary>FastAPI application factory responsible for creating and configuring the main application instance. Implements comprehensive middleware stack, exception handling, health checks, and router registration. The file follows async patterns and includes proper lifecycle management with database and cache initialization. Overall healthy but has opportunities for improvement in code organization and adherence to project-specific standards like UUIDv7 usage.</summary>

  <positive_observations>
    <observation>Excellent use of async/await patterns throughout, following project standards for async I/O</observation>
    <observation>Comprehensive exception handling with proper distinction between development and production error messages</observation>
    <observation>Well-structured lifespan management with proper resource cleanup</observation>
    <observation>Good separation of concerns with modular router registration</observation>
    <observation>Proper use of Pydantic models for API responses</observation>
    <observation>Comprehensive health check implementation with service-level status reporting</observation>
    <observation>Good use of structured logging with contextual information</observation>
    <observation>Proper CORS and security middleware configuration</observation>
  </positive_observations>

  <context>
    <tests>No test file found for this module. Tests should be created in tests/test_app.py</tests>
    <documentation>File has basic docstrings but could benefit from more detailed documentation of configuration options and middleware behavior</documentation>
    <configuration>Configuration properly externalized through settings module with environment-based controls</configuration>
