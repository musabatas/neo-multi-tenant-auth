      <title>Predictable Password Generation Pattern</title>
      <location>Lines 318-321</location>
      <description>Password generation uses standard Python secrets module without enforcing specific character requirements. While cryptographically secure, passwords may not meet the realm's own password policy defined at line 272</description>
      <recommendation>Ensure generated passwords comply with the realm's password policy (12 chars, 2 upper, 2 lower, 2 digits, 2 special) by using a dedicated password generator that guarantees policy compliance</recommendation>

      <title>Wildcard CORS Origins in Development</title>
      <location>Lines 199-200</location>
      <description>Default configuration uses wildcard '*' for redirect URIs and web origins, which allows requests from any origin. This is insecure even for development environments</description>
      <recommendation>Use specific allowed origins even in development, or at minimum restrict to localhost patterns. Never use '*' wildcards in production configurations</recommendation>

      <title>Sensitive Data in Return Values</title>
      <location>Line 357</location>
      <description>Admin password is returned in plain text in the response dictionary. While noted as "only returned on creation", this still poses a risk if logged or cached</description>
      <recommendation>Consider returning a flag indicating password was generated rather than the actual password, or use a secure channel for password delivery</recommendation>

      <title>Inefficient Client Initialization</title>
      <location>Lines 35-39</location>
      <description>The _get_client method creates a new client connection on first call but doesn't handle connection pooling or reconnection scenarios</description>
      <recommendation>Implement connection pooling and health checks to reuse connections efficiently and handle disconnections gracefully</recommendation>

    <issue category="performance" severity="LOW">
      <title>Missing Batch Operations</title>
      <location>Lines 268-296, 299-313</location>
      <description>Realm setup performs multiple sequential operations that could be batched or parallelized for better performance</description>
      <recommendation>Consider batching realm configuration and client setup operations, or use asyncio.gather for parallel execution where dependencies allow</recommendation>

      <description>The create_tenant_realm method is 119 lines long, exceeding the project's 80-line limit per function standard</description>
      <recommendation>Refactor into smaller helper methods: _setup_realm_configuration, _create_admin_user, _update_tenant_database to improve readability and maintainability</recommendation>

      <description>Realm configuration settings are hardcoded in the method rather than externalized to configuration</description>
      <recommendation>Move default realm settings to a configuration file or environment variables for easier maintenance and environment-specific customization</recommendation>

      <title>Inconsistent Async Pattern</title>
      <location>Line 38</location>
      <description>The get_keycloak_client() is awaited but the keycloak_client field isn't typed as Awaitable, creating ambiguity about the client's actual type</description>
      <recommendation>Add proper type hints for self.keycloak_client to clarify it holds the resolved client, not an awaitable</recommendation>

  <summary>
    This file implements multi-tenant realm management for Keycloak integration, handling dynamic realm configuration, client management, and caching. The module provides a RealmManager class that interfaces with Keycloak to create and manage authentication realms for different tenants. While the implementation follows many project patterns including async operations and proper caching, it has several areas needing improvement including function length violations, incomplete implementations, and security concerns around CORS wildcards and password handling.
  </summary>

  <positive_observations>
    - Excellent use of async/await patterns throughout, consistent with project standard #7
    - Proper caching implementation with TTL and cache invalidation strategies
    - Good separation of concerns with database queries isolated from business logic
    - Comprehensive docstrings explaining purpose and parameters for all methods
    - Proper use of custom exceptions (NotFoundError, ConflictError, ExternalServiceError)
    - Follows singleton pattern consistent with project patterns for utility services
    - Includes proper realm configuration with security settings like brute force protection
    - Good logging practices with appropriate log levels (debug, info, warning, error)
    - Validates tenant state (is_active) before operations
  </positive_observations>

  <context>
    <tests>No test file found for this module. Unit tests should be created to cover realm management operations, caching behavior, and error scenarios</tests>
    <documentation>Module has comprehensive docstrings but lacks integration documentation explaining how it fits into the broader authentication flow</documentation>
    <configuration>References settings through get_database() and get_cache() but realm configuration is hardcoded rather than externalized</configuration>
