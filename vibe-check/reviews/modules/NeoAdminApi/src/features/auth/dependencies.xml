      <title>Potentially Sensitive Information in Logs</title>
      <location>Line 211</location>
      <description>User permissions are being logged at the warning level when access is denied, potentially exposing sensitive permission information in logs</description>
      <recommendation>Consider logging only the permission check failure without showing actual user permissions, or use a debug level for detailed permission logging</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="security" severity="LOW">
      <title>Generic Error Messages Could Aid Attackers</title>
      <location>Lines 81-82</location>
      <description>Generic error handling converts all exceptions to "Invalid or expired token", which is good for security but logs the actual error which could expose system details</description>
      <recommendation>Ensure error logs are not accessible to unauthorized users and consider using structured logging with security classification</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="performance" severity="LOW">
      <title>Duplicate Permission Extraction Logic</title>
      <location>Lines 84-103 and 251-269</location>
      <description>Permission extraction logic is duplicated between _extract_permissions method and get_user_permissions function</description>
      <recommendation>Extract common permission extraction logic to a shared utility function to avoid duplication and improve performance</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="maintainability" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Complex Permission Checking Logic</title>
      <location>Lines 194-206</location>
      <description>The nested if-else logic for checking any_of vs all permissions with wildcard support is complex and could be hard to maintain</description>
      <recommendation>Consider extracting permission matching logic into separate helper methods for better readability and testability</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="maintainability" severity="LOW">
      <title>Hardcoded Permission Names</title>
      <location>Lines 117-118</location>
      <description>Permission names like "admin", "platform_admin", "superadmin" are hardcoded as strings</description>
      <recommendation>Consider using an enum or constants module for permission names to avoid typos and improve maintainability</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="LOW">
      <title>Mixed Permission Format Handling</title>
      <location>Lines 183-189</location>
      <description>Code handles both old string format and new object format for permissions, indicating technical debt from a migration</description>
      <recommendation>Document the migration timeline and plan for removing backward compatibility once all systems are updated</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="LOW">
      <title>Missing Type Hints for Internal Methods</title>
      <location>Line 84</location>
      <description>The _extract_permissions method is missing return type hint in its implementation</description>
      <recommendation>Add complete type hints to all methods including internal ones for better type safety</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="code_smell" severity="LOW">
      <title>Large Class with Multiple Responsibilities</title>
      <location>Lines 121-222</location>
      <description>CheckPermission class is 100+ lines and handles multiple concerns including permission validation, caching, and user authentication</description>
      <recommendation>Consider splitting into smaller focused classes or extracting some logic to service methods</recommendation>

  <summary>Authentication dependencies module for FastAPI routes providing JWT token validation, user authentication, and permission checking. Integrates with Keycloak for token validation and implements both token-based and database-based permission checking. The module follows FastAPI dependency injection patterns and provides reusable authentication components for the platform.</summary>

  <positive_observations>
    <observation>Excellent use of FastAPI dependency injection pattern with composable authentication dependencies</observation>
    <observation>Proper async/await patterns throughout the module following project standards</observation>
    <observation>Good separation of concerns with distinct classes for different authentication aspects</observation>
    <observation>Implements dual validation strategy for tokens (local JWT + server introspection) for performance optimization</observation>
    <observation>Comprehensive error handling with proper exception types and logging</observation>
    <observation>Supports flexible permission checking with any_of and all logic plus wildcard support</observation>
    <observation>Follows project patterns for singleton services and caching strategies</observation>
    <observation>Well-structured code with clear class responsibilities and good documentation</observation>
    <observation>Implements superadmin bypass for permission checks as a security feature</observation>
    <observation>Backward compatibility handling for permission format migration</observation>
  </positive_observations>

  <context>
    <tests>No test file found for this module. Unit tests should be created to cover authentication flows, permission checking logic, and error scenarios.</tests>
    <documentation>Module has good inline documentation with docstrings for classes and key methods. Could benefit from more detailed documentation on permission format migration.</documentation>
    <configuration>Uses settings from common.config.settings for Keycloak configuration. Properly integrates with token_manager and realm_manager services.</configuration>
