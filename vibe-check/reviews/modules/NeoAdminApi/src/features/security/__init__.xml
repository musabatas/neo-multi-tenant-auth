      <title>Missing Module Implementation</title>
      <location>Entire file</location>
      <description>The security module __init__.py is completely empty. This is a placeholder module that exists in the directory structure but has no implementation, making it unusable for its intended purpose.</description>
      <recommendation>Implement the module following the established project pattern: export routers with descriptive aliases (e.g., security_router, audit_router) from subdirectories. See regions/__init__.py for reference.</recommendation>

      <title>Inconsistent with Project Pattern #68</title>
      <location>Entire file</location>
      <description>Feature module __init__.py files should export multiple routers with descriptive aliases according to project pattern #68. This file is empty and doesn't follow the established convention.</description>
      <recommendation>Follow the pattern used in other feature modules: import routers from subdirectories and export them with __all__. Example: from .routers.security import router as security_router</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="HIGH">
      <title>No Module Exports</title>
      <location>Entire file</location>
      <description>The module doesn't export any public API through __all__, making it unclear what should be imported from this module.</description>
      <recommendation>Define __all__ to specify the public API of the module, exporting the necessary routers, services, or utilities.</recommendation>

    <issue category="best_practices" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Missing Module Documentation</title>
      <location>Entire file</location>
      <description>No module-level docstring to explain the purpose and contents of the security feature module.</description>
      <recommendation>Add a module docstring at the beginning of the file describing the security module's purpose, such as handling audit logging, rate limiting, and security-related operations.</recommendation>

    <issue category="maintainability" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Incomplete Module Structure</title>
      <location>Subdirectories</location>
      <description>The security module has subdirectories (audit, models, rate_limiting, repositories, routers, services) but their __init__.py files are also empty, indicating an incomplete implementation.</description>
      <recommendation>Complete the implementation of subdirectories and ensure proper exports are configured at each level of the module hierarchy.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="code_smell" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Dead Code Structure</title>
      <location>Entire module</location>
      <description>The module structure exists but contains no implementation, creating dead code that adds no value but increases codebase complexity.</description>
      <recommendation>Either implement the security module with its intended functionality or remove it until implementation is ready to avoid maintaining empty placeholder structures.</recommendation>
    </issue>
  </issues>

  <summary>The security module __init__.py file is completely empty (0 lines), serving as a placeholder in the NeoAdminApi feature structure. This module appears to be intended for security-related functionality including audit logging, rate limiting, and security services, but currently lacks any implementation. The file violates project pattern #68 which requires feature module __init__.py files to export routers with descriptive aliases. The empty state makes the module unusable and inconsistent with other implemented feature modules like regions and organizations.</summary>

  <positive_observations>
    <observation>The directory structure is properly organized following the feature module pattern with appropriate subdirectories for audit, models, rate_limiting, repositories, routers, and services.</observation>
    <observation>The file exists in the correct location within the features directory structure.</observation>
  </positive_observations>
