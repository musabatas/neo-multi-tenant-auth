      <title>SQL Injection Vulnerability in build_where_clause</title>
      <location>Lines 68-92</location>
      <description>The field names extracted from dictionary keys are directly interpolated into SQL queries without validation. The actual_field variable is computed by string slicing (e.g., field[:-7]) and directly inserted into SQL statements, allowing potential SQL injection through crafted field names.</description>
      <recommendation>Validate field names against an allowed list before using them in queries. Consider using a whitelist of permitted column names or a regex pattern to ensure field names contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="security" severity="HIGH">
      <title>Unvalidated ORDER BY Clause in paginated_list</title>
      <location>Line 183</location>
      <description>The order_by parameter is directly interpolated into the SQL query without validation. This could allow SQL injection if user input can control this parameter.</description>
      <recommendation>Validate the order_by parameter against a whitelist of allowed columns and sort directions. Consider parsing it to extract column name and direction separately, then validate each component.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="performance" severity="LOW">
      <title>Redundant Count Query in paginated_list</title>
      <location>Line 153</location>
      <description>The count query and data fetch query could potentially be combined using window functions for better performance, reducing database round trips.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider using COUNT(*) OVER() window function to get total count in the same query as the data fetch, especially for smaller result sets.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="maintainability" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Function Exceeds 80 Line Limit</title>
      <location>Lines 130-193</location>
      <description>The paginated_list method is 63 lines long but performs multiple distinct operations (count, build WHERE, build query, execute). While under 80 lines, it's approaching the project limit and could be refactored for better maintainability.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider extracting the query building logic into a separate method to improve readability and testability.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="maintainability" severity="LOW">
      <title>Missing Type Hints in build_where_clause Return</title>
      <location>Line 44</location>
      <description>The return type uses lowercase 'tuple' instead of 'Tuple' from typing module, which is inconsistent with other type hints in the file.</description>
      <recommendation>Change 'tuple[str, List[Any], int]' to 'Tuple[str, List[Any], int]' after importing Tuple from typing.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Standard logging Instead of loguru</title>
      <location>Line 14</location>
      <description>The file uses standard Python logging module while the project patterns indicate loguru is the preferred logging library for structured logging.</description>
      <recommendation>Replace 'import logging' with 'from loguru import logger' to align with project-wide logging patterns.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="code_smell" severity="LOW">
      <title>Magic Number in build_where_clause</title>
      <location>Lines 69, 73, 77, 81</location>
      <description>String slicing uses magic numbers (-7, -4, -5) to remove suffixes. These could be made more maintainable with constants or a mapping.</description>
      <recommendation>Define constants for suffix lengths or use a dictionary mapping suffixes to their operators for clearer intent.</recommendation>

  <summary>Base repository class providing common database operations using asyncpg for the NeoMultiTenant platform. The implementation follows the repository pattern with async operations and includes pagination, filtering, and soft delete functionality. The code has critical security vulnerabilities related to SQL injection that must be addressed immediately. Overall structure is good and aligns well with project patterns.</summary>

  <positive_observations>
    <observation>Excellent use of async/await patterns throughout, consistent with project requirement #7</observation>
    <observation>Well-documented with comprehensive docstrings for all public methods</observation>
    <observation>Good use of Generic types and TypeVar for type safety</observation>
    <observation>Proper use of asyncpg without ORM, following project pattern #27</observation>
    <observation>Implements soft delete pattern consistently across all operations</observation>
    <observation>Good separation of concerns with abstract methods for create/update</observation>
    <observation>Proper use of connection pooling through DatabaseManager</observation>
    <observation>Comprehensive pagination implementation with offset/limit calculation</observation>
  </positive_observations>

  <context>
    <tests>No test file found for this repository base class. Unit tests should be created to verify SQL generation, pagination logic, and edge cases.</tests>
    <documentation>Class and method documentation is comprehensive with clear docstrings explaining parameters and return values.</documentation>
    <configuration>Properly integrates with database configuration through DatabaseManager and follows connection pool patterns.</configuration>
