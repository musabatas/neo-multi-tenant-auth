    <issue category="security" severity="HIGH">
      <title>Password stored in plaintext in memory</title>
      <location>Lines 167, 184</location>
      <description>The encrypted_password is aliased as 'password' and stored directly in memory cache without additional protection. Even though it's fetched as 'encrypted_password', it's exposed in plaintext in DSN strings and memory structures.</description>
      <recommendation>Use a secure password manager, decrypt only when needed, and clear from memory after use. Consider using connection pooling with encrypted credentials that are decrypted only at connection time.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="security" severity="HIGH">
      <title>DSN with credentials logged</title>
      <location>Line 199</location>
      <description>The log message includes connection_name which could potentially expose sensitive connection details if DSN or connection details are included in error messages.</description>
      <recommendation>Ensure DSN strings with credentials are never logged. Use a sanitized version for logging that excludes passwords.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="performance" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Repeated database metadata imports</title>
      <location>Lines 76-79, 88-91, 100-103</location>
      <description>MetadataCollector is imported inside methods that could be called frequently, causing repeated import overhead.</description>
      <recommendation>Import MetadataCollector once at module level and handle ImportError there, or use a lazy import pattern with caching.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="performance" severity="LOW">
      <title>No connection pooling warmup strategy</title>
      <location>Lines 25-35, 201-209</location>
      <description>Connection pools are created with min_size but no warmup strategy, which could cause initial connection delays.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider pre-warming connection pools during initialization to avoid cold start penalties.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="maintainability" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Global state management</title>
      <location>Lines 254-256, 269-272</location>
      <description>Global singleton instances using module-level variables can make testing difficult and create hidden dependencies.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider using dependency injection or a proper singleton pattern with explicit lifecycle management.</recommendation>

    <issue category="maintainability" severity="LOW">
      <title>Magic numbers without explanation</title>
      <location>Lines 27, 203</location>
      <description>Hard-coded pool sizes (min_size=10 and min_size=5) without explanation of why these values were chosen.</description>
      <recommendation>Extract to configuration constants with explanatory comments or make configurable via settings.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="maintainability" severity="LOW">
      <title>Inconsistent error handling</title>
      <location>Lines 114-116, 247-249</location>
      <description>Error handling returns False for health checks but raises exceptions elsewhere, making error handling inconsistent.</description>
      <recommendation>Establish consistent error handling strategy - either always raise exceptions or always return error indicators.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="consistency" severity="LOW">
      <title>Inconsistent pool size configuration</title>
      <location>Lines 27, 203</location>
      <description>DatabaseManager uses min_size=10 while DynamicDatabaseManager uses min_size=5, without clear rationale for the difference.</description>
      <recommendation>Standardize pool configuration or document why different values are needed.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Missing connection retry logic</title>
      <location>Lines 25-35, 201-209</location>
      <description>No retry logic for connection pool creation, which could fail due to transient network issues.</description>
      <recommendation>Implement exponential backoff retry logic for connection establishment.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="LOW">
      <title>No connection pool metrics</title>
      <location>DatabaseManager and DynamicDatabaseManager classes</location>
      <description>No monitoring of pool metrics like active connections, wait times, or pool exhaustion.</description>
      <recommendation>Add pool metrics collection for monitoring connection pool health and performance.</recommendation>

    <issue category="best_practices" severity="LOW">
      <title>Missing type hints for Record import</title>
      <location>Line 180</location>
      <description>Using Record from asyncpg in type hint without explicit import in type checking block.</description>
      <recommendation>Use proper type checking imports to avoid runtime overhead.</recommendation>

    <issue category="code_smell" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Circular dependency potential</title>
      <location>Lines 76, 88, 100, 129</location>
      <description>The dynamic imports and get_database() call in load_database_connections could create circular dependencies.</description>
      <recommendation>Refactor to avoid circular imports by separating concerns or using dependency injection.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="code_smell" severity="LOW">
      <title>Duplicate connection acquisition pattern</title>
      <location>Lines 62-70, 72-82, 84-94, 96-106</location>
      <description>Similar connection acquisition and release pattern repeated across multiple methods.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider a decorator pattern or helper method to reduce duplication.</recommendation>

  <summary>Database connection management module using asyncpg for both static admin database and dynamic multi-region database connections. Provides connection pooling, transaction support, and health checking. The module follows async patterns consistently but has security concerns with password handling and several areas for improvement in error handling and monitoring.</summary>

  <positive_observations>
    <observation>Excellent use of async/await patterns throughout, adhering to project standards</observation>
    <observation>Proper use of context managers for connection and transaction management</observation>
    <observation>Good separation of concerns between static and dynamic database managers</observation>
    <observation>Comprehensive logging for important operations</observation>
    <observation>Support for multi-region database architecture with dynamic connection loading</observation>
    <observation>Proper use of asyncpg for high-performance database operations as per project requirements</observation>
    <observation>Transaction support with proper isolation</observation>
    <observation>Health check functionality for monitoring database availability</observation>
  </positive_observations>

  <context>
    <tests>No test file found for this module. Unit tests needed for connection management, pool lifecycle, and error scenarios.</tests>
    <documentation>Module has basic docstrings but lacks comprehensive documentation on security considerations and multi-region setup.</documentation>
    <configuration>Properly uses settings from common.config.settings module.</configuration>
