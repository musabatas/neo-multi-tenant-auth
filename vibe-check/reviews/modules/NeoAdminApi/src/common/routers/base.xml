      <title>Logger Created on Every Function Call</title>
      <location>Lines 73-75</location>
      <description>The logger is created inside the decorator function that runs on every route registration. While this happens during startup, it could be more efficient to create the logger once at module level.</description>
      <recommendation>Move logger creation to module level (after line 11) to avoid repeated logger instantiation.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="maintainability" severity="LOW">
      <title>Debug Logging Could Be Conditional</title>
      <location>Line 75</location>
      <description>Debug logging is always attempted even in production. While it won't output if not configured, the string formatting still occurs.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider checking logger level before formatting: if logger.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG)</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="consistency" severity="LOW">
      <title>Import Location Not Following Project Pattern</title>
      <location>Lines 73-74</location>
      <description>The logging import is inside a function rather than at the module top, which differs from the project's standard import organization pattern.</description>
      <recommendation>Move import logging to the top of the file with other imports.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="LOW">
      <title>Missing Type Hints for Return Type</title>
      <location>Line 70</location>
      <description>The inner decorator function lacks explicit return type annotation, though the outer function has proper typing.</description>
      <recommendation>Add explicit return type hint: def decorator(func: DecoratedCallable) -> DecoratedCallable:</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="code_smell" severity="LOW">
      <title>Function Slightly Exceeds Length Guideline</title>
      <location>Lines 24-82</location>
      <description>The api_route method is 59 lines, approaching the 80-line limit. While still acceptable, the nested decorator adds complexity.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider extracting the path determination logic (lines 46-54) into a separate helper method for better readability.</recommendation>

  <summary>Custom APIRouter implementation that elegantly solves FastAPI's trailing slash redirect issue by automatically registering both URL variations. The implementation is clean, well-documented, and follows object-oriented principles. Minor improvements could be made in logger initialization and import organization.</summary>

  <positive_observations>
    <observation>Excellent documentation with clear docstrings explaining the problem being solved and usage examples</observation>
    <observation>Clean inheritance pattern extending FastAPIRouter with minimal modifications</observation>
    <observation>Smart solution to avoid 307 redirects by registering both URL patterns</observation>
    <observation>Proper handling of edge cases like root path "/"</observation>
    <observation>Good use of type hints for function signatures</observation>
    <observation>Schema duplication avoided by setting include_in_schema=False for alternate paths</observation>
    <observation>Follows project's dual pattern registration convention (pattern #4 from scratchsheet)</observation>
  </positive_observations>

  <context>
    <tests>No unit tests found for this router implementation. Testing custom router behavior would ensure URL handling works correctly.</tests>
    <documentation>Comprehensive inline documentation with module docstring, class docstring, and method docstring with proper Args/Returns sections.</documentation>
    <configuration>No specific configuration required; works as a drop-in replacement for FastAPIRouter.</configuration>
