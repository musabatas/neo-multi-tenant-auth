      <title>Fixed Salt for Key Derivation</title>
      <location>Line 36</location>
      <description>Using a hardcoded salt 'NeoMultiTenantSalt' for PBKDF2 key derivation undermines the security of the derived keys. A fixed salt makes the system vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.</description>
      <recommendation>Generate a random salt for each encryption key and store it alongside the encrypted data, or use a different salt per tenant/environment.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="security" severity="HIGH">
      <title>Fallback to Plaintext on Decryption Failure</title>
      <location>Line 84-86</location>
      <description>When decryption fails, the method returns the original encrypted value assuming it might be plaintext. This creates a security vulnerability where attackers could potentially bypass encryption by providing malformed data.</description>
      <recommendation>Throw an exception on decryption failure or return a clear error state. Never silently return potentially encrypted data as plaintext.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="security" severity="HIGH">
      <title>Default Encryption Key in Development</title>
      <location>Line 25</location>
      <description>Using a default hardcoded encryption key 'dev-encryption-key' in production code is a critical security vulnerability. This default could accidentally be used in production.</description>
      <recommendation>Remove the default value and require explicit configuration. Fail fast if no encryption key is provided rather than falling back to an insecure default.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="security" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Global Mutable State for Encryption Instance</title>
      <location>Line 106-123</location>
      <description>Using a global mutable singleton pattern creates potential race conditions in async environments and makes testing difficult.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider using dependency injection or a context-aware pattern that's compatible with async FastAPI architecture.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="performance" severity="LOW">
      <title>Synchronous PBKDF2 in Async Context</title>
      <location>Line 39-44</location>
      <description>PBKDF2HMAC with 100,000 iterations is computationally expensive and runs synchronously, which could block the event loop in an async FastAPI application.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider using an async-compatible key derivation or caching the derived cipher to avoid repeated derivation.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="maintainability" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Side Effect in get_encryption Function</title>
      <location>Line 119-121</location>
      <description>The get_encryption() function modifies os.environ as a side effect, which can lead to unexpected behavior and makes testing difficult.</description>
      <recommendation>Initialize the encryption key through proper application startup configuration rather than modifying environment variables at runtime.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="maintainability" severity="LOW">
      <title>Broad Exception Handling</title>
      <location>Line 84</location>
      <description>Catching all exceptions with a bare 'except Exception' makes debugging difficult and could mask programming errors.</description>
      <recommendation>Catch specific exceptions like InvalidToken from Fernet to handle expected failure cases.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="consistency" severity="LOW">
      <title>Import Pattern Inconsistency</title>
      <location>Line 120</location>
      <description>Importing from 'src.common.config.settings' uses absolute import path while project typically uses relative imports within modules.</description>
      <recommendation>Use relative import: 'from ..config.settings import settings' to maintain consistency with project patterns.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Missing Type Hints for Exceptions</title>
      <location>Line 84</location>
      <description>The decrypt_password method doesn't document or type hint that it can silently fail and return unexpected values.</description>
      <recommendation>Add return type annotations that indicate possible failure states or use Optional/Union types.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="LOW">
      <title>No Async Support</title>
      <location>Throughout</location>
      <description>The encryption module is synchronous while the project uses async patterns throughout for I/O operations.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider providing async variants of encryption methods for better integration with async FastAPI endpoints.</recommendation>
    </issue>
    
    <issue category="code_smell" severity="LOW">
      <title>Magic String for Encryption Detection</title>
      <location>Line 102</location>
      <description>Relying on Fernet tokens starting with 'gAAAAA' is fragile and implementation-dependent.</description>
      <recommendation>Consider using a more robust method like attempting decryption or maintaining encryption metadata.</recommendation>

  <summary>Password encryption utility module providing PBKDF2+Fernet-based encryption for database passwords and sensitive data. While the implementation follows the general structure from NeoInfrastructure, it contains critical security vulnerabilities including fixed salts, fallback to plaintext on errors, and hardcoded default keys that must be addressed before production use.</summary>

  <positive_observations>
    <observation>Good use of established cryptographic libraries (cryptography.fernet) rather than rolling custom crypto</observation>
    <observation>Clear docstrings with proper parameter and return type documentation</observation>
    <observation>Convenience functions provide a clean API for common operations</observation>
    <observation>Proper use of PBKDF2 with reasonable iteration count (100,000) for key derivation</observation>
    <observation>Singleton pattern prevents multiple encryption instances with different keys</observation>
  </positive_observations>

  <context>
    <tests>No test file found for this module - needs unit tests for encryption/decryption and edge cases</tests>
    <documentation>Module has comprehensive docstrings but lacks security warnings about the fixed salt and default key issues</documentation>
    <configuration>Relies on APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable or settings.app_encryption_key</configuration>
