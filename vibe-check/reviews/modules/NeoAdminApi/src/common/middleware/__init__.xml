  <summary>
    This is a well-structured middleware package initialization file that acts as the main entry point for the NeoAdminApi middleware system. It provides clean exports of all middleware components including structured logging, security headers, CORS, rate limiting, and performance monitoring. The module follows best practices with proper documentation, type hints implied through the exports, and a clear factory pattern for environment-specific configurations. The convenience functions setup_middleware() and get_middleware_status() provide simple APIs for middleware integration while maintaining flexibility for custom configurations.
