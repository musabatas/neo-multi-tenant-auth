      <title>Client IP extraction can be spoofed</title>
      <location>Lines 258-272</location>
      <description>The _get_client_ip method trusts X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers without validation, allowing IP spoofing when not behind a trusted proxy</description>
      <recommendation>Implement a trusted proxy configuration and only use forwarded headers when request comes from trusted sources. Consider using an IP validation library</recommendation>

    <issue category="security" severity="LOW">
      <title>Request body logged without content validation</title>
      <location>Lines 297-322</location>
      <description>Request body is logged for JSON content types without checking for sensitive data patterns (passwords, tokens, credit cards)</description>
      <recommendation>Implement content scanning for sensitive patterns before logging request bodies, or provide configuration for fields to exclude</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="performance" severity="LOW">
      <title>Request body read without streaming for large bodies</title>
      <location>Lines 300-301</location>
      <description>The entire request body is read into memory which could cause issues with large payloads</description>
      <recommendation>For bodies larger than max_body_size, consider streaming or chunked reading to avoid memory issues</recommendation>

    <issue category="maintainability" severity="LOW">
      <title>Exception handling too broad in dispatch method</title>
      <location>Lines 117-121</location>
      <description>Generic Exception catch makes it harder to handle specific error conditions differently</description>
      <recommendation>Consider catching specific exceptions (HTTPException, ValidationError) separately for more granular error handling</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="best_practices" severity="MEDIUM">
      <title>Hardcoded performance thresholds</title>
      <location>Lines 213-224</location>
      <description>Performance classification thresholds (5.0s, 1.0s, 0.1s) are hardcoded and not configurable</description>
      <recommendation>Make performance thresholds configurable through class initialization parameters</recommendation>

    <issue category="best_practices" severity="LOW">
      <title>Silent ImportError handling</title>
      <location>Lines 89-93</location>
      <description>ImportError for MetadataCollector is silently ignored without logging, making debugging harder</description>
      <recommendation>Log a debug message when MetadataCollector import fails to aid troubleshooting</recommendation>
    </issue>
    <issue category="code_smell" severity="LOW">
      <title>Long dispatch method approaching limit</title>
      <location>Lines 56-121</location>
      <description>The dispatch method is 65 lines long, approaching the 80-line project limit</description>
      <recommendation>Consider extracting request preparation and response handling into separate methods</recommendation>

  <summary>Comprehensive structured logging middleware implementing correlation IDs, request/response tracking, and performance monitoring. The middleware provides excellent observability features with proper context propagation through ContextVars. Overall well-structured with good async patterns and security considerations, but has minor issues with IP spoofing protection and configurable thresholds.</summary>

  <positive_observations>
    <observation>Excellent use of ContextVars for request context propagation across async operations</observation>
    <observation>Comprehensive structured logging with all required context (tenant_id, user_id, request_id, correlation_id)</observation>
    <observation>Proper use of async/await patterns throughout, adhering to project standards</observation>
    <observation>Good security awareness with sensitive header redaction and configurable logging options</observation>
    <observation>Consistent use of UUIDv7 for ID generation as per project requirements</observation>
    <observation>Well-documented with clear docstrings explaining features and purpose</observation>
    <observation>Smart performance classification with automatic log level adjustment</observation>
    <observation>Proper error handling with context preservation during exceptions</observation>
  </positive_observations>

  <context>
    <tests>No test file found for this middleware. Unit tests should cover correlation ID extraction, context propagation, error scenarios, and performance threshold classification</tests>
    <documentation>Well-documented with comprehensive docstrings and inline comments explaining complex logic</documentation>
    <configuration>Middleware is highly configurable with sensible defaults for logging options, excluded paths, and sensitive headers</configuration>
