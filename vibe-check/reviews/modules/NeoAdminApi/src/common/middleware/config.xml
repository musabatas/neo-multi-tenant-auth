      <title>Default lambda field factory exposes mutable defaults</title>
      <location>Lines 87-89</location>
      <description>The trusted_hosts_enabled field uses a lambda as default factory which can potentially expose mutable default values in configuration</description>
      <recommendation>Consider using a regular default value or ensuring the lambda doesn't expose mutable state</recommendation>

      <title>Security headers potentially disabled in some paths</title>
      <location>Lines 44-45</location>
      <description>Security headers are excluded for documentation paths, which could be a minor security concern if these endpoints are exposed in production</description>
      <recommendation>Consider applying security headers to all paths or ensuring documentation endpoints are properly protected in production</recommendation>

      <title>Long method with repetitive pattern</title>
      <location>Lines 128-172</location>
      <description>The _add_middleware method contains repetitive if-elif patterns that could be simplified using a registry pattern or dictionary mapping</description>
      <recommendation>Refactor to use a middleware registry pattern to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability</recommendation>

  <summary>This file provides comprehensive middleware configuration management for the FastAPI application. It implements a flexible middleware manager with configurations for logging, security, timing, rate limiting, CORS, and trusted hosts. The implementation follows the Factory pattern with environment-specific configurations (development, production, testing). The code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns and follows async patterns consistent with the project standards.</summary>
