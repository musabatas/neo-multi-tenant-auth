"""Platform events infrastructure repository implementations.

Repository implementations handle data persistence for platform events system.
Following maximum separation architecture patterns.

Each repository file has single responsibility:
- asyncpg_event_repository.py: ONLY event data access with PostgreSQL
- redis_event_cache.py: ONLY event caching with Redis (future implementation)

Note: Action-related repositories have been moved to platform/actions module.
