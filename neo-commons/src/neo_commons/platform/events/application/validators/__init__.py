"""Platform events application validators.

Validators handle input validation and business rule enforcement in the platform events system.
Following maximum separation architecture - each validator has single responsibility.

Each validator file has single responsibility:
- event_validator.py: ONLY event validation logic
- webhook_validator.py: ONLY webhook validation logic
- payload_validator.py: ONLY payload validation logic
- condition_validator.py: ONLY condition validation logic

Action-related validators have been moved to platform/actions module.
