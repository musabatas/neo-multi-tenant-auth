"""Platform events application services.

Services handle orchestration logic in the platform events system.
Following service-oriented architecture patterns.

Each service file has single responsibility:
- event_dispatcher.py: ONLY event dispatching orchestration
- webhook_delivery.py: ONLY webhook delivery orchestration

Action-related services have been moved to platform/actions module.
Monitoring services will be implemented at neo-commons level.
