# File Management Feature Development Plan

## Overview

Implementation of enterprise-grade file management feature for neo-commons following maximum separation architecture patterns from cache, events, and actions features.

## Architecture Goals

- **Maximum Separation**: One file = one purpose across all layers
- **Protocol-Based DI**: @runtime_checkable interfaces for all external dependencies  
- **Clean Core**: Domain entities and value objects with no external dependencies
- **Storage Abstraction**: Support for local and S3 storage providers
- **Multi-tenancy**: Tenant-isolated file operations with proper permissions

## Database Schema Integration

âœ… **Migrations Created**:
- `V1014__create_file_management_infrastructure.sql` - Admin database tables
- `V2006__create_tenant_file_management_infrastructure.sql` - Tenant template tables
- `V1015__add_file_storage_system_settings.sql` - System configuration

- Integrates with RBAC system for file permissions
- Supports team-based access control

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- 100% protocol-based dependency injection
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (>90%)
- Integration tests for storage providers
- End-to-end tests for upload/download workflows
- Type hints for all public interfaces

### Error Handling
- Structured exception hierarchy with proper HTTP mapping
- Graceful degradation for storage provider failures
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Comprehensive error logging with context

### Documentation Standards

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **S3 Integration Complexity**: Multipart uploads, presigned URLs, error handling

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive integration testing with real S3 buckets
- Permission caching with intelligent invalidation
- Asynchronous quota calculation with periodic updates
- Fallback strategies for virus scanner failures
