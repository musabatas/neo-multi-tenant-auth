# Neo-Commons Core Module Review

## Overview
The `core` module in `neo-commons/src/neo_commons/core` provides foundational elements including exceptions, protocols, shared entities, and value objects. It is organized into subdirectories: `entities` (empty, entities moved to features), `exceptions` (detailed hierarchy), `protocols` (empty, moved), `shared` (context, protocols), and `value_objects` (identifiers). This review analyzes these files (16 in total, all read completely) against the requirements for dynamic handling of connections, override capabilities, and DRY principles.

### Key Components
- **`entities/`**: Empty; entities moved to feature-specific modules to avoid circular dependencies.
- **`exceptions/`**: Comprehensive hierarchy of exceptions for domains like auth, database, infrastructure, with HTTP mappings.
- **`protocols/`**: Empty; protocols moved to `shared` and `infrastructure`.
- **`shared/`**: Includes `RequestContext` entity, domain/application protocols (e.g., TenantContextProtocol, PermissionCheckerProtocol).
- **`value_objects/`**: Immutable ID classes like UserId, TenantId for type safety.

## Analysis of Requirements

### 1. Dynamic Connection Management
Requirements: Dynamic acceptance of connections (e.g., DB, Keycloak) passed by services.

- **Current Implementation**:
  - Protocols like `SchemaResolverProtocol` support dynamic schema resolution based on tenant_id.
  - `RequestContext` holds dynamic info like tenant_id, schema_name, used for per-request dynamism.
  - Exceptions like `ConnectionError`, `SchemaResolutionError` handle dynamic failures.
  - No concrete implementations here; abstractions suggest support for dynamic behaviors.

- **Bottlenecks**:
  - **Abstraction Without Implementation**: Core defines protocols (e.g., for schema resolution), but if implementations (in features/infrastructure) rely on static configs, dynamism is limited. Core doesn't enforce parameter-passing for connections.
  - **Assumed Structures**: Protocols assume tenant_id for dynamism, but if a service needs non-tenant-based dynamism (e.g., per-user DB), it might not fit.
  - **Keycloak-Specific Exceptions**: Exceptions like `KeycloakConnectionError` assume Keycloak, limiting dynamic use of other auth providers without custom exceptions.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Ensure protocols include methods for passing configs dynamically (e.g., add to `SchemaResolverProtocol`).
  - Generalize auth exceptions to avoid provider-specific ties.

### 2. Override Functionality
Requirements: Services should override functionalities (e.g., custom user returns).

- **Current Implementation**:
  - Protocols (e.g., `PermissionCheckerProtocol`, `UserResolverProtocol`) allow services to provide custom implementations.
  - Value objects are simple dataclasses, easy to extend or compose.
  - Exceptions can be subclassed for custom error handling.
  - `RequestContext` is extensible with metadata.

- **Bottlenecks**:
  - **Rigid Exception Hierarchy**: Many specific exceptions (e.g., `RealmNotFoundError` for Keycloak) might force services to use them or duplicate if overriding with different auth.
  - **Moved Entities/Protocols**: While clean, it requires services to import from multiple places, potentially complicating overrides.
  - **No Built-in Extension Points**: For example, `RequestContext` fields are fixed; overriding requires subclassing, but not encouraged in code.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Add more abstract base exceptions for common cases, allowing provider-specific subclasses.
  - Provide base classes for entities like `RequestContext` with clear extension guidelines.

### 3. DRY Principles
Requirements: Centralized configs/features to avoid duplication across services.

- **Current Implementation**:
  - Centralized exceptions prevent duplicated error handling.
  - Protocols ensure consistent interfaces, reducing boilerplate.
  - Value objects standardize ID handling.
  - Comments emphasize clean architecture to avoid circular dependencies.

- **Bottlenecks**:
  - **Provider-Specific Code**: Keycloak-tied exceptions might lead to duplication if services use alternatives.
  - **Scattered Protocols**: Moved to shared/infrastructure, which is good for separation but could cause import duplication if not managed well.
  - **Empty Directories**: While intentional, might confuse developers, leading to accidental duplication.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Use more generic names for exceptions (e.g., `AuthProviderError` instead of `KeycloakError`).
  - Provide comprehensive __all__ exports for easy importing.

## Overall Assessment
The core module excels in providing abstractions and type safety, supporting overrides via protocols. However, provider-specific elements (e.g., Keycloak) could hinder dynamism and force duplication. DRY is well-maintained through centralization.

Score (out of 10):
- Dynamic Connections: 6/10 (good abstractions, but assumes specific providers)
- Overrides: 8/10 (protocols enable custom implementations)
- DRY: 9/10 (strong centralization and clean design)

Next Steps: Generalize exceptions and ensure protocols support full dynamism.
